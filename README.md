## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the application.
3. Due to browser security restrictions on local files, the app may not work as expected when opening `index.html` directly in a web browser.
4. To fully experience the Streaming Services Aggregator, use a local development server like the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

Enter the name of the movie or TV show in the search box and click on the 'Search' button or press 'Enter' to find the title. Click on the 'Details' button next to the title name to view more information and available streaming platforms.
